## 🔍 AUTO-DEPLOY DIAGNOSIS

### ❌ Problem Identified:

**Vercel is connected to WRONG repository!**

```
You're pushing to:
  ✅ Smangesh20/job-portal-project
  ✅ infinite-quantum-god-rahul/market

Vercel is watching:
  ❓ Unknown (likely different repo)
  ❓ Possibly: smangesh/askyacham-portal
```

**Result:** Vercel never sees your pushes → No auto-deploy triggered

### ✅ Solution Provided:

**5-Minute Fix:**
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard → Settings → Git
2. Check "Connected Git Repository"
3. If wrong repo → Disconnect
4. Connect to: `Smangesh20/job-portal-project`
5. Enable auto-deploy for `main` branch

**Complete instructions in:** `FIX_AUTO_DEPLOY_NOW.md`
