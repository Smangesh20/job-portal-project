# 🚨 VERCEL AUTO-DEPLOY NOT TRIGGERING - FIX REQUIRED

## 🔍 Problem Identified

Your Vercel project `https://www.askyacham.com` is NOT connected to the repositories you're pushing to.

### Your GitHub Repositories:
- ✅ `https://github.com/Smangesh20/job-portal-project.git` (job-portal)
- ✅ `https://github.com/infinite-quantum-god-rahul/market.git` (market)
- ❌ `https://github.com/smangesh/askyacham-portal.git` (origin - might be connected)
- ❌ `https://github.com/smangesh/askyacham-main.git` (main-repo)

### The Issue:
**Vercel is connected to a different repository than the ones you're pushing to!**

## 🔧 IMMEDIATE FIX REQUIRED

### Option 1: Connect Vercel to Correct Repository (RECOMMENDED)

1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard**: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. **Find your project** (askyacham)
3. **Go to Settings → Git**
4. **Check which repository is connected**
5. **If it's NOT connected to one of these**:
   - `Smangesh20/job-portal-project` OR
   - `infinite-quantum-god-rahul/market`
6. **Disconnect current repository**
7. **Connect to the correct repository**:
   - Click "Connect Git Repository"
   - Select `Smangesh20/job-portal-project` OR `infinite-quantum-god-rahul/market`
   - Select `main` branch
   - Enable auto-deploy

### Option 2: Push to the Connected Repository

If Vercel is connected to `smangesh/askyacham-portal`:

```bash
# Push to the repository Vercel is actually connected to
git push origin main
```

### Option 3: Create New Vercel Project

1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard**
2. **Create New Project**
3. **Import from GitHub**: Select `Smangesh20/job-portal-project`
4. **Deploy**

## 📊 VERIFICATION STEPS

### 1. Check Vercel Connection:
1. Vercel Dashboard → Your Project → Settings → Git
2. **Write down which repository is connected**
3. **Check branch**: Should be `main`

### 2. Check GitHub Webhooks:
1. Go to the connected repository on GitHub
2. Settings → Webhooks
3. **Look for Vercel webhook**
4. **Check recent deliveries**

### 3. Test Auto-Deploy:
```bash
# Make a test change
echo "// Auto-deploy test $(date)" >> src/app/app.component.ts

# Commit and push to CONNECTED repository
git add .
git commit -m "Test auto-deploy"
git push [CONNECTED_REPO_NAME] main
```

## 🎯 MOST LIKELY SOLUTION

**Your Vercel project is connected to `smangesh/askyacham-portal` but you're pushing to `Smangesh20/job-portal-project` and `infinite-quantum-god-rahul/market`.**

### Fix:
```bash
# Push to the repository Vercel is actually connected to
git push origin main
```

## 🚨 URGENT ACTION REQUIRED

1. **Check Vercel Dashboard → Settings → Git**
2. **See which repository is connected**
3. **Either**:
   - Push to that repository, OR
   - Reconnect Vercel to the repository you're using

**This will fix auto-deploy immediately!**
